# NonLethalWeapons
A RimWorld mod. Does what it says on the tin.  

# Disclaimer
This mod is in pre-alpha, but everything in it is functional.  

This is a mod intended to solve one issue - the inability to knock a colonist out without doing major damage. You have a colonist on a rampage and they are about to break your cooler in the summer but you don't have any healroot? These non-lethal weapons will be your saving grace.
