## [0.1.1] - 2018-12-18
- added the beanbag shotgun (craftable at the machining table after the applicable research is complete)
    - cheaper, slower, more inaccurate at far range but more accurate at close range, much smaller range than the tranquilizer gun
    - adds a Pain Sensitivity Hediff that increases the target Pawn's sensitivity to pain significantly, and increasing amounts (it stacks, but also wears off)
- refactored code a smidge to make it more reusable
