## [0.1.4 - Update to RW1.2] 2020-08-18

Getting back into the swing of things. Trying to balance the Tranq gun. Checked on Beanbag gun as there were questions - it works as expected.
- Dropped amount of tranq to apply by .1 something
- Reduced accuracy a smidge at longer ranges
- increased cool down time by .05

## [0.1.3 - Update to RW1.1] 2020-02-17

- Jumped on the update bandwagon
- Easy update, just the requisite to get it working
- I will continue to update this as time goes on
  - I am starting a project with a group, and it's resparked my interest, so here we are

## [0.1.2 - tranq balance] 2018-12-21

- balancing the tranq gun
  - current is great for players but... not so great when raiders spawn with it
  - reducing range to... air rifle ish? values. Will continue to tweak
  - reducing accuracy to be reasonable

## [0.1.1 - graphics update] 2018-12-20

- updated graphics for the tranq gun and the bean bag shotgun
  - @Axinex did the tranq gun
  - I did the bean bag shotgun

## [0.1.1] - 2018-12-18

- added the beanbag shotgun (craftable at the machining table after the applicable research is complete)
  - cheaper, slower, more inaccurate at far range but more accurate at close range, much smaller range than the tranquilizer gun
  - adds a Pain Sensitivity Hediff that increases the target Pawn's sensitivity to pain significantly, and increasing amounts (it stacks, but also wears off)
- refactored code a smidge to make it more reusable
